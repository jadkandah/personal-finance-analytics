# Personal Finance Analytics Platform

An end-to-end personal finance analytics system for tracking, analyzing, and forecasting personal expenses using Python and SQL.

This project focuses on building a complete data pipeline, from data ingestion and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Collect and store personal expense data in a structured format
- Clean, preprocess, and categorize financial transactions
- Analyze spending patterns and trends
- Visualize insights through an interactive dashboard
- Forecast future expenses using baseline machine learning models
- Ensure data privacy and reproducibility

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

Raw Data → Cleaning → Categorization → Storage → Analysis → Visualization → Forecasting


The system is designed to be modular, allowing each component to be developed, tested, and extended independently.
